## ANIMAL PLAYGROUND

Animal playground is a two-person team group project.

It is an e-commerce platform and was made in two parts, in chronological order : 
  - first we designed the back-end API in TypeScript, NodeJS and the framework Express (and mySQL for the database).
  - then we worked on the front-end to consume it using React-NextJS.
  
Each of the two folders contains a README that explains the functionalities and implementation in more details.
