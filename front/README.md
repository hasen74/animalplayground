Welcome to the animal playground e-commerce website page !

## Getting Started

On Animal Playground, we sell pet toys for all kinds of pets.

The react-coded UI connects to the same-named API and database.

The **home** page features a sample of products of different categories.

## Account & orders

In order to shop on the website, you need to be logged in.
The **account** page allows you to register for a user account.

You can then log in and log out : the website relies on client's session storage to store and access the JWToken info.

Once connected, you can add products to your **cart**, confirm your order and see your confirmed **orders' history**.

## Admin page

A link to the **admin** page is hidden in the second hash sign of the footer.
The API features a **users' roles system** to control access rights.
Access to the **admin** page is only granted to admins.

Once on the page you can add a product to the catalogue, or delete it by ID.
Ask us for a sample admin account credentials.

Enjoy !
